## Assumptions (inferred, not explicitly confirmed)

| Item | Assumption | Basis | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service area | Oberrieden / Bezirk Horgen / linkes Zürichseeufer | History page says "Bezirk Horgen" as original area; current address is 8942 Oberrieden | Medium — may serve wider area now |
| Current leadership | Ramon + Luzian Dörfler | History page shows them taking over in 2004, no contrary info | Low |
| Emergency service | Available (phone reachable on Sundays/holidays) | Team page states weekend/holiday reachability | Medium — not marketed as "Notdienst" explicitly |
| Primary brand color | Unknown — website has no clear modern palette | Old static HTML site | High — needs founder input or logo extraction |
| Logo | Exists on website (image file) but not extractable as SVG/PNG | Homepage references logo image files | Medium — need founder to provide file |

---
